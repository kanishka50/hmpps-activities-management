# Dispatch the Config A / Config B pilot pair, STRICTLY ONE RUN AT A TIME.
#
# Two properties this script exists to guarantee:
#   1. SERIAL EXECUTION. Concurrent runs would share GitHub's infrastructure
#      and contaminate each other's measurements, so each run is watched to
#      completion before the next is dispatched.
#   2. RANDOMISED ORDER FROM A FIXED SEED. If configurations ran in a fixed
#      A,B,A,B order, any drift in GitHub's runner fleet over the collection
#      window would align with configuration and be indistinguishable from a
#      treatment effect. The order is shuffled, and the seed is recorded so the
#      schedule is reproducible.
#
# Usage:  bash experiment/run-pilot.sh [REPLICATES] [SEED]
#         bash experiment/run-pilot.sh 10 20260916
